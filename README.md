How to get adb access on an ANS F30 flip phone

The ANS F30 phone is an Android based flip phone sold by US Cellular.  This phone is a particular challenge to get adb access to, as adb is disabled by
default, there is no option in the settings app to enable developer settings, and the default dialer app does not have the permissions needed to send the
debug secret code.
